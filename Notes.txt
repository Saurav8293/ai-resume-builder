What we are building now:

A very small Python server that can receive data from your JavaScript and send back a response.

That’s it.
No AI yet.
No API key yet.
Just communication.

Think of it like this:

Browser (JS)  --->  Python Server  --->  Browser


If you understand this, GenAI backend becomes easy later.

📁 STEP 0 — Create the backend folder

Before writing any code, do this:

Create a new folder called:

backend


Inside backend, create a file:

app.py


Do NOT write anything yet.

Reply “Folder and app.py created”
Then we start writing line 1.

(Important mindset reminder)

We are not writing Python because Python = AI.
We are writing Python because AI models live on servers, not browsers.

Reply when ready 👇

Folder and app.py created

Excellent. Now we start for real — one line, one reason.

🧩 STEP 1 — Create the Python application object

👉 Write ONLY this single line in backend/app.py:

from flask import Flask


STOP. Don’t write anything else.

🧠 Why are we writing this line?
1️⃣ What is flask?

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework

It lets Python act like a server

Your browser (JavaScript) can talk to it using HTTP

Without Flask:

Python is just a script

It cannot listen to browser requests

2️⃣ Why from flask import Flask?

Flask is a class

We will use it to create our server app

Think of it like:

import express from "express";


in Node.js.

Same idea. Different language.

3️⃣ Why not AI yet?

Because AI runs inside a server.
First we build the server.
Then we add intelligence.

This is how real GenAI systems are built.

✅ Your turn

Reply with:

“Written Step 1”

Then we move to STEP 2, where we actually create the server object.

Written Step 1

Perfect. 👍
Now we add exactly one more line.

🧩 STEP 2 — Create the Flask app (server instance)

👉 Add this line just below the previous one in app.py:

app = Flask(__name__)


STOP here. Don’t add anything else.

🧠 Why are we writing this line?
1️⃣ What is Flask(__name__)?

Flask is a server factory

__name__ tells Flask where this file lives

Flask uses it to:

locate files

know how to run the app

You don’t need to overthink __name__ now — just know:

“Flask needs it to configure itself correctly.”

2️⃣ What is app?

app is your actual web server

Later we will tell it:

“listen on this URL”

“handle this request”

“send this response”

In JavaScript terms, this is like:

const app = express();

3️⃣ Why is this step critical?

Without this line:

You cannot define routes

You cannot receive data

You cannot connect AI later

This is the foundation of your GenAI backend.
